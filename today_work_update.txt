Today's Work Summary
=====================

Successfully trained and deployed a Person Re-Identification system achieving 99.5% detection precision with YOLOv8, capable of maintaining consistent identity tracking across video frames with zero ID switches and 100% re-identification success rate.

Completed AWS deployment cost analysis for production scaling, identifying GPU configurations ranging from $170-$895/month that would provide 5-20x faster processing (25-100 FPS vs current 4.4 FPS).
